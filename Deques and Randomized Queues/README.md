# Programming Assignment 2: Deques and Randomized Queues

> Please navigate to the official [assignment URL](http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/queues.html) for complete details.

Write a generic data type for a deque and a randomized queue. The goal of this assignment is to implement elementary data structures using arrays and linked lists, and to introduce you to generics and iterators.

**Dequeue.**
A double-ended queue or deque (pronounced “deck”) is a generalization of a stack and a queue that supports adding and removing items from either the front or the back of the data structure.

**Randomized queue.**
A randomized queue is similar to a stack or queue, except that the item removed is chosen uniformly at random from items in the data structure.
